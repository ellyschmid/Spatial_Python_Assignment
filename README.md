# Spatial_Python_Assignment
This Project uses a RCNN (region based concolutional neural network) for the detection of ships. As training Image, a Sentinel-1 Scene from the Suez-Canal was applied, by using the 95 percentile of the Sentinel Backscatter Image in VH polarization, that inhances the visiability of ships.
